Accuracy (calculated for the above confusion matrix) = 10/34 = 29.41%

Results for the individual labels:
       Yes :    P =    0/   0 =   0.00%     R =    0/  16 =   0.00%     F1 =   0.00%
        No :    P =    0/   0 =   0.00%     R =    0/   8 =   0.00%     F1 =   0.00%
      Uns. :    P =   10/  34 =  29.41%     R =   10/  10 = 100.00%     F1 =  45.45%

Micro-averaged result:
P =   10/  34 =  29.41%     R =   10/  34 =  29.41%     F1 =  29.41%

MACRO-averaged result:
