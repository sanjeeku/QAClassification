Q10_C1	http www qatarliving com answers living in qatar any hindu temple write temple on the search at the right hand side u will find many threads on this topic 
Q10_C2	Qatar is basically an islamic country and they see asian expats as slaves and nothi8ng more So u may see churches here but you wont find temples And idol worship is not allowed in islam Hence you wont find temples here I hope one day qatar changes the attitude of seeing asians as slaves 
Q10_C3	Shayampsundar You are prejudiced against Qatar why not you leave this country if your religious sentiments are being bashed as you claim Asians are slave Are you treating yourself as a leader of again community here Beware such statements can lead to your deportation also i know you are still a kid based on your profile but refrain from unworthy comments otherwise this would lead to problem for your parents who are earning their livelihood here and feeding you 
Q10_C4	SHYAM SUNDER are they treating u as a slave or do u consider yourself to be a rotten slave coz i do not think that any one here has bothered to chain ur legs to some shackles here and kept u bonded u are here just for your some meaningful gains and u are making yourself a slave to the country like any respect a human being deserves everyone has the freedom to choose to stay or go away from a place he likes or dislikes so if u do not like the systems here y the hell are u making urself a slave or a DOG over here get lost man to ur own country and iam sure wherever u go u will definitely treat others as slaves so cheers 
Q10_C5	shayampsundar u have the right to speak out and give ur comment or suggestion but u should respect Qatar or the relegion Islam by giving comments to ur brother if somebody treated u as slave don t generalized all the locals or Qatari we all know most indians was lazy and trying hard they think that they know everything but we know that their really something talkative and staburn

Q296_C3	I read this thread while researching the Triptic requirements for my drive from Doha to London Now that I am back in London I think I can dispel some of the myths I drove from Doha through Saudi Jordan Syria Turkey Greece Italy Germany and Holland before taking a ferry to the UK The car had a Qatari number plate Saudi first You do not need a Triptic just a visa Transit in my case which is usually valid for 3 days There is nowhere to buy a Triptic anywhere near the Jordan border Jordan There is no need for a Triptic or advance visa This can be bought at the border along with car insurance Syria There is no need for a Triptic I had a visa from the Syrian Embassy in Doha Insurance can be bought at the border Turkey There is no need for a Triptic Visa can be bought at the border along with car insurance Greece no Triptic requirement Insurance can be bought at the border and covers the whole EU for one month Having entered the EU there are no further visa insurance or Triptic requirements Egypt has a Triptic requirement but is a nightmare to drive in I would recommend leaving the car in Aqaba and taking the ferry to Nuweiba where coaches operate to Cairo

Q296_C8	Hi Friend Hope u will have a safe trip to Egypt Yes u need to get a trip ticket book from Qatar riving club in c ring road with a Qatari sponsorship For ur car is still under installment no problem to leave Qatar but don t ask the bank to give u a letter to leave Qatar with ur car Also u must have a valid Qatari license and u must make car insurance in the Saudi border and it will cost u 75 00 Saudi riyals per trip u have two ways to reach Egypt 1a thru Deba to hurghada by a high speed fairy boat and the trip will last for 4 hours approx 1b Thru Deba to Safaga and it will take about 12hours and I dont prefer it 2 Thru Jordan from Al Aqaba to Sharm el Sheikh and the trip will take about 6 Hours by sea I hope that the above information is useful to u and it will help u to take the right direction

Q545_C11	An interesting article http m arabianbusiness com qatar alcohol ban could be tip of iceberg for gcc 440454 html Qatars move to ban the sale of alcohol on its flagship Pearl development may hint at the start of a Gulf wide clampdown on booze sales as governments look to pacify local fears analysts said The GCC states may move to rein in sales and tighten alcohol legislation in a bid to walk the line between the expatriate population and their Muslim citizens in the wake of the Arab Spring unrest said Guy Wilkinson managing partner at Dubai hospitality consultancy Viability Qatar is hardly the first Gulf state in which the local population has expressed its concerns over the sale of alcohol he told Arabian Business Following the Arab Spring I expect Muslim parties to have more and more influence over the control of alcohol throughout the region The sale of alcohol is strictly monitored in five of the Gulf states with Saudi Arabia operating an outright ban on the sale and consumption of liquor The move to offer alcohol licenses to outlets and non Muslims is largely a nod to the regions expatriate workers who vastly outnumber the local population But the decision has been met with criticism from some citizens who oppose the sale of liquor in Muslim countries Qatar retains comparatively tight rules governing alcohol consumption said Wilkinson Just a few years back one could only find it in just a few luxury hotels and clubs with strict entry procedures he said The fact that its population has increased so fast over the last few years has evidently not changed the concerns of Muslims over the potential ill effects of alcohol consumption particularly in terms of moral behaviour Chiheb Ben Mahmoud head of Hotel Advisory for MENA at Jones Lang LaSalle said the open sale of alcohol was always a delicate balance for Gulf governments Sometimes local public opinion is heated up on the back of a combination of factors It is common for authorities in these cases to act swiftly in order to defuse tension and prevent the issue from heating up further and getting out of control he said The suspension of sales on the Pearl could be seen as a wake up call or a reminder of the invisible red lines not to be crossed

Q757_C4	I think you don t have I think you don t have permission to bring big pet so for kind information you should contact Qatar Pet Travel http www amirafoods com 
Q757_C5	heleneg Great Danes are not banned in Qatar and big dogs have always been allowed into Qatar Whoever you are getting your info from is feeding you false information Please go to www qatarpetrelocators com for info and mail contact qatarpetrelocators com for assistance with brining your animal Doha is not a bad place for pets Its the same the world over Just because Qatar is a small country it seems like we are over run with animals Just remember that when taking your pet from Qatar Europe if thats where you go to next requires added documentation 
Q757_C6	Yes just try contact Qatar Yes just try contact Qatar pet travel i understand your desire of bringing your Dane with you my daughter like your age is also keeping another kind so adorable and sweet Try search of possibilities of bringing her in 
Q757_C7	Seriously Up to last year big dogs were not allowed but things are obviously changing As Oryx suggested contact Qatar Pet Travel 
Q757_C8	Thank you all for answers I was actualy considering to drive to Qatar with the dog It will be a lot cheaper and it will be an amazing experience I just thought that the great dane might have been on the ban list in Qatar But I will try to contact the pet travel company to hear their say 
Q757_C9	How would you drive here How would you drive here You as a female are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia I don t know where you re coming from but if for example you re coming from UAE you would need the proper documents issued by the UAE authorities vets probably documents allowing you to import transit an animal via Saudi if a man is doing the driving and if you are married to him his sister or his daughter or his mother and then more docs to allow the dog to enter Qatar If you re coming from further afield and have more countries to pass through it gets even more complicated on the document side I suspect nearly all of these countries would require a vet inspection by their vet before allowing the dog entry transit through their country 
Q757_C10	I will be coming from Denmark And I will of course make sure that the dog is fully vaccinated and have all it s documents in order and that goes for every country we will transit Also I would have my stepfather come and pick me up in Saudi as women are not allowed to drive there When I was last in Doha I was told that bringing a Great Dane was illegal and impossible but now I see that they are only restricted so I guess I have all my questions answered Luckily my family lives in a big house with a nice garden with the lagoona in the backyard so apart from the heat the dog wouldn t get it any better 
Q757_C11	Saudi may not recognize your Saudi may not recognize your step father as your step father You should check that out before making any firm plans

Q803_C1	They sell all of those group of drugs in the pharmacy some you will need a local prescription for available from a primary health doctor or specialist but usually just buy over the counter You are required to carry a medical certificate or copy of prescription when entering Qatar in case you get checked but as long as you are just taking the medication for yourself and not trying to import it for others you will be ok Receiving medications of any kind by post is an absolute no It is illegal and anything medicinal will be kept by customs including a face mask I ordered from Elemis but I did get it back

Q820_C3	ex ex Yes he is American but he has Asian roots and if you know your land well you will know that the Asians over in the West are know for having a savings account So maybe he does not lead the extravagant lifestyle your family leads and 2000 may suffice for him for starters IMHO depending on where he worked yes he could get more than 2000 in the US but the problem over there is there is more supply than demand for the type of work he is looking for

Q820_C7	Yes he s just starting off and he hasn t even got a degree Wouldn t it be better to tell him the truth and encourage him to get a degree rather than chase low salary half way around the world to a place that is more expensive than where he is

Q947_C4	I think its not a problem I think its not a problem but she will not be elgible for meternity leave before one yr 
Q947_C5	Normally pregnancy is not Normally pregnancy is not looked as a hindrance Esp in the govt sector here in doha But better to mention orally before the tests go through Honesty never fails 
Q947_C6	Looking at it from an HR Looking at it from an HR point of view she s not a good investment First of all she ll have to take quite a bit of time off in her first 9 months for doctors appts sick leave etc as well as 54 days of maternity leave and the likely hood of her coming back to work is slim I wouldn t hire her 
Q947_C7	As per experience yes it As per experience yes it will surely affects her job offer I am one of the recruitment officer in one of the govt offices before and its one of the policy that they can t hire a pregnant women even in some govt private offices that i ve known Their reasons 1st they will thought that you will be going to file your long day leave upon delivery or often to file a leave during pregnancy 2nd they will probably thought that you cannot exert ur best effort in doing your job because usually pregnant women feels so many body changes body pains etc and sometimes some superior are hesitant to give work load to their staff if she is pregnant 3rd ur medical results will be stamped as UNFIT to work if found out that your pregnant So the best thing if your planning to look for work dont get pregnant but you can get pregnant if you already hired or started to work bec that s 2 different case 
Q947_C8	Even with the smiley face Even with the smiley face that is harsh prism p not true for many many pregnant women but mm is right too Anyway even while being pregnant and hormonally on a roller coaster pregnant women can be extremely active and bring good results on the work front Coming to the op if the medical is already over then nothing really to worry about except probation may go longer once they know the employee is pregnant If medical is not complete yet and if the candidate is really required by the company then a temporary job offer may be presented to her and only when she returns back from her maternity leave will her job become permanent It all depends upon their hr policies

Q947_C10	I wish her all the best I wish her all the best 
Q947_C11	han19 I didnt mean to be han19 I didnt mean to be harsh just stated reality from a corporates POV for idiots I think there is no issue for pregnant women coming on board afresh other women have already elaborated on it and smiley was just to soften the pinch of reality But still if it sounds harsh my apologies to whomever it may concern as it was unintentional 
Q947_C12	If she receives a job offer If she receives a job offer letter and later gets turned away then she may file a claim for discrimination I don t know if that can go anywhere in this legal system But if she gets hired her employer will have the right of putting her under unpaid leave during the 50 day maternity leave period For more details read Art 96 of the Labour Law see below A female worker who has been employed by an employer for a complete year shall be entitled to maternity leave with full pay for a period of fifty days Such maternity leave shall include the period before and after the delivery provided that the period following the delivery shall not be less than thirty five days 
Q947_C13	2012 Olympics I have worked 2012 Olympics I have worked as a recruiter for over 14 years and I can witness how women can be far more productive during their pregnancy 
Q947_C14	Maybe they can But your Maybe they can But your view is not the view of most employers here 
Q947_C15	In my similar yrs of working In my similar yrs of working under along side and in supervising capacity didnt see or hear anyone of them being as productive when they were not pregnant the toughest ones were those who had the hobby of getting pregnant every year finding someone to delegate for them used to be a big challenge for understandable reasons 
Q947_C16	Well 2012 Olympics the way Well 2012 Olympics the way you wrote your previous comment made it looked more like your own perspective AS an employer Testing an applicant for pregnancy is nothing but an act of discrimination I cannot argue whether is legal or not in this country but is just my humble opinion on this particular issue Prism I know what you re talking about but it s a matter of education and culture and companies would need to enforce a strict recruitment control ensuring that all applicants go through proper channels and procedures We all suffer the same not only from pregnant women but also from male slackers who will keep calling in sick almost every sunday or thursday for no apparent reason 
Q947_C17	after the medical check up after the medical check up they will inform to the employer and it s the employer decision if the employer is ok with that they have no problem to accept you and process your papers

Q1106_C1	Yes you can sell your car You have to take the buyer of your car to the bank and settle all your remaining amount in the bank plus pay you if the total price of the car beyond or higher than the remaining amount in the bank After that process done the bank will give out NOC to you for you to hand over the NOC to the new buyer for him to process with the traffic police department to change the ownership You have to go along with the new buyer to the Insurance company to change the ownership before proceed to the traffic police department for changing the ownership and renewal of the registration card Cheers

Q1347_C1	Why not contact UDC if they are your developer to get a clear picture good or bad rather than rely on others who may or may not be well informed and could be giving you accurate information or idle speculation I am also an investor in The Pearl and have found in all my dealings with UDC ie the people at the Oyster that they are very professional helpful and transparent They will tell you the situation as it stands now progress and delays because it is in their interests to ensure that investors have confidence in them and their project My apartment is in Viva Bahriya so not due for completion yet It is hard to wait because once you ve been down and seen for yourself the scope of the project you just want to move in and enjoy sitting on your balcony overlooking the sea Ignore the snipers stay cool it will be worth the wait 
Q1347_C2	I know it is hard to wait especially given the current economic uncertainty but none of us including the developer and the banks could have predicted what has happened on a global scale over the last few months so we are all having to adjust to the new reality which we didnt foresee when we originally made the investment As any investment is about confidence it doesn t make sense to talk down the project or encourage rumours about how awful the project is If you look at other threads on this subject you can see that those directly involved in the construction are all proud of it only those unconnected but with inside knowledge ie from friends of friends are predicting doom Again I suggest that you go down to the site and speak to the developer to get a clearer picture which will help you plan 
Q1347_C3	No one lives at the Pearl yet As there is no water or electricity services yet UDC and Kharamma are locked in a power struggle over costs and the poor buyers of flats are the losers 
Q1347_C4	Having followed up with UDC I have learned that the issue with the power supply was in fact resolved almost 2 weeks ago and they expect people to be living in Porto Arabia by the end of May Please don t take my word for this after all I could just be another one spreading rumors check with them yourself to see how your property fits into the schedule Hope it goes well for you 
Q1347_C5	I talked to UDC and they said their towers will be opened in May Electricity and water problems are solved and ready for all porto arabia I guess in the 4th Quarter of this year most of the towers will be opened I was in Abu Dhabi at the weekend and stayed in one of my friends apartment His apartment is having a magnificent sea view next to beach like the apartment in the pearl It gives me some idea how the life will be in the pearl simply dolce vita Most of the people living in Doha cannot imagine the life style in the pearl and when it will be completed I am sure it will be one of the dream place to live in So we waited a lot but I guess it will worth it 
Q1347_C6	Istavrit I was down there this week as well and totally amazed at the progress especially with the shops OK just need the money to buy cafes and landscaping The waterfront is beautiful and the atmosphere unlike anywhere else in Doha more reminiscent of Palm Beach or parts of Europe The project is really moving on and taking shape

Q1607_C3	Please judge based on evidence or personal experience It s that time of the year when new comers to Qatar begin exploring schools for their children Good luck with it all It is not an easy process But I think it would be more helpful if people spoke from personal experience and based on evidence Impressions and second hand information can be misleading BTW my kids go to Sherborne and I am pleased with it I don t think it will be comparable to the Dorset school It can t be and I don t judge it on that basis I judge it on the curriculum staff activities interaction with parents etc As for fees while it is not cheap it is less expensive than Compass ASD and ACS Doha I think DESS is subsidized right Good luck with ACS and when you ve gone through the experience please write about it I am sure many people will want to know

Q1607_C5	Dintovich what do you mean Dintovich what do you mean about being honest I have nothing to hide whatsoever And we are very happy with the school my children go to I have no reason to consider change But if I were then rich kids would certainly not be a deterrent for me Although except for some Qatari children i have not seen any rich kids here 
Q1607_C6	you are right kiwinyc it you are right kiwinyc it seems like Dintovitch does have a very large chip indeed which makes me suspicious about how genuine the comments are perhaps the fees are too high for them or their kids did not get in when they applied or they are they elsewhere and are worried about some of these new up and coming schools taking away students might go and have a look at sherborne myself so there is your answer Dintovitch my children are not at sherborne but i have heard many good things about it now answer expatlady 
Q1607_C7	In a court of law the judge In a court of law the judge does not examine the motives of why a witness says this or that but looks at what has been said is it or could it be true or false If we start on the road of why somebody says something or another we will end up nowhere I could for example retort by asking why you out there are you trying to protect Sherborne Qatar and I could go into theorizing about you perhaps being British and want to protect your national school or your kids are in that school and you want to justify your decision for taking them there or many large number of possible motives If we go along this road there will be no end to the discussion Let us instead try to be rational and confine ourselves to facts and not to what is in the hearts and cannot be seen It doesn t really matter whether I have a chip on my shoulder or not you will never find out what matters is what I have said about Sherborne Qatar is it or could it be true or false This is what we should look at Also when I say spoilt rich kids I don t mean they are spoilt because they are rich per se no those unfortunate kids are the kind that have been brought up mostly not by their parents but by the maids not even trained nannies who are in the palaces And regarding this point the same will apply to ACS Doha Another point needs clearing I did not say that Sherborne Qatar is bad as teaching goes but it could be bad for your kid because of the demographics I said that it will never be like Sherborne UK because the raison d etre for Sherborne Qatar is different from that for Sherborne UK Sherborne Qatar has shareholders who will siphon money away from it unlike Sherborne UK Please also remember that Sherborne UK is only a secondary boarding school which means Sherborne is new in the primary school field Why did they start with primary school in Qatar Is it because it is a bigger market 
Q1607_C8	Sherborne Prep in Dorset was Sherborne Prep in Dorset was established in 1858 for students from aged 3 13 years therefore I think they have some primary school experience It runs alongside Sherborne Boys and Sherborne Girls Senior Schools They also have an international school in the UK which prepares overseas students for entry into their main schools The schools are both day and boarding There is a clear understanding and acceptance that Sherborne Qatar wishes to establish its own identity whilst keeping some of the values from the mother school 
Q1607_C9	If you google Sherborne Prep If you google Sherborne Prep in Dorset you will find that it has nothing to do with the 560 years old Sherbone UK It just has the name Sherborne by virtue of being in Sherborne town If you visit Sherborne UK website you will find that the only link they have is Sherborne Qatar Also the schools logos are different As for the International School that prepares overseas students for entry into the main Sherborne I know nothing about and I don t know whether it even exists If it does I am sure it is totally separate from the main Sherborne that we know It could be a private school that has thought of exploiting the niche of preparing students to the main Sherborne So I stand by what I said earlier that they have not managed a primary or a prep school before I am not saying this makes then inadiquate no I don t know about that but just that they were willing to undergo such an experience for the sake of financially supporting Sherborne UK You will get just as good an education if not better for your kids somewhere else cheaper and without being hit by the demographics I mentioned earlier 
Q1607_C10	Wow I didn t realize Wow I didn t realize Thanks for the post Dintovitch 
Q1607_C11	Not only that it will never Not only that it will never be the same as Sherborne in the UK because of the spoilt rich kids but also because here in Qatar Sherborne is for profit unlike its sister in the UK because a they have a Qatari partner to whom they should pay dividends and b part of the extra money they make goes to support the true Sherborne in the UK which is facing some financial difficulties why do you think they are here in the first place You are right AngelinaBallerina Sherbornr Qatar can never be as Sherborne UK All in all I think Sherborne Qatar will mar the name and the old academic tradition of Sherborne UK

Q1607_C20	Be careful it is one where Be careful it is one where spoiled rich children with bad habits and manners conglomerate Because it is so overpriced and because of its location it would attract mostly these types Remember your child will learn more from his peers than from his teachers There are still many good schools where your child will much happier Take Sherborne which is a very good school in the UK I hear but here in Qatar it is suffering from the same problem I mentined above 
Q1607_C21	well my children are not well my children are not spoilt dont have bad manners havent any bad habits you would worry about and we are not rich neither are their friends of which they have many For you information children learn first and foremost from their parents and taking into consideration your highly critical letter I am trying to picture your children if you have any of course If parents bring up their children well enough they will not be affected so much by negative peer pressure whatever school they are in 
Q1607_C22	Hello d esertmum Where are Hello d esertmum Where are your kids How can you be not rich and have your kids attend one of these schools And if the company is paying the fees then your salary must be quite high ACS Doha has not started yet anyway so do your kids go to Sherborne Hope to hear from you because I disagree that kids don t learn much from their peers peer pressure is a strong force

Q1677_C1	Never think about it maintinance cost is very high and the resell value is very low 
Q1677_C2	Ask previous Volvo owners If you ask the vast majority of Qatar Living members that will drive nothing but Japanese cars then you won t get an honest answer Also please do remember that you are buying a prestige brand so the cost of maintaining that will be more than a cheap volume brand When it comes to customer service at Volvo service centres please just try them once They are professional courteous and most of all honest If you would like any information or history on the car you are buying please do not hesitate to contact me on 6022476 I work for DOMASCO Volvo and we DO VALUE ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS 
Q1677_C3	I ve been using Volvos for about 5 years now both in Qatar and in the UK and they have proven to be very reliable cars The cost of maintenance is slightly higher than most but then you are getting what you pay for Regarding the comment about cars falling apart after 5 years I think that person was talking about American cars 
Q1677_C4	I agree with Joe90 The S80 a great car Here in North America both Volvo and Honda are considered great cars and Toyota that offer great value and great service from dealers It s disappointing to hear the dealers of these cars n Qatar doesn t hold up their end of the bargain You d hardly need to worry about a Volvo breaking down When it does yes parts are a bit more expensive than Japanese cars but nowhere near the level of Mercedes or BMW It s comfortable and safe huge trunk sporty feel You could feel the heavy weight of the car when you first start driving it which is why it uses as much gas as it does I love mine but sadly have to sell it soon when I move to Doha So that s why relatively I see less Hondas on sale on this site than Toyotas The dealership I was wondering why I don t see the Honda Ridgeline and Pilot listed anywhere nor the Toyota Sienna Honda s mystery solved

Q1837_C1	one year visit visa what is this somebody give u wrong information i think this is a residence visa if visa printed as ENTRY PURPOSE FAMILY VIS expiry date one year from birth date me and my wife are under different sponsor i have one year old baby and my daughters visa printed as family visit we visit india two times last year 
Q1837_C2	i think you re having a wrong picture in your mind if your baby is born in qatar he she will NOT be issued with VISIT VISA visit visa is issued only to a person outside qatar and for the purpose of visiting if you have done the birth certificate and have signed the documents at CID due to 2 sponsers for you and your wife your baby is issued with the RP I think it s better you show your babys RP or visa as you say to somebody who can read arabic and get confirmed 
Q1837_C3	Something not right here My husband and I are with different sponsors Our baby was born a few months back and was issued a family visa Quite straightforward The only extra step is u ll need to go to the CID office and show them ur papers Once the baby gets his passport u ll need to go back there with a copy of the passport No idea why though

Q1898_C7	Lorenteggio it is alright Lorenteggio it is alright You are not the first person to do so But its just the way people could ask Maybe something like how much would suffice for a good life in Qatar People on Qatarliving vary in status and the salaries vary as well People earn QR2000 to QR 150000 a month So it might hurt people to know that others are making what they would save in 350 years Just my opinion I wish you a happy stay in Qatar once you arrive Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret

Q1898_C16	Ciao Lorenteggio i m not in Ciao Lorenteggio i m not in finance so couldn tcomment how that offer compares with the local rate but I would say that you have to judge how much better of you ll be than at home Cost of living is definitely higher than in italy but depends a lot if you have accomodation included you re going to pay at least QAR14 000 per month for somewhere OK to live If it s only a little above average salary at home then I d say it isn t going to make you a lot better off but this depends on your tax situation Not sure how the italian tax works but no tax payable here You have to bear in mind that while Qatar is very safe and you can buy most things here prosciuto excepted it s not the most comfortable or exciting place to live so you ll end up spending a lot on flights and holidays to stay sane Good luck FG

Q2189_C7	Hi Alexa I m asking a Hi Alexa I m asking a rethorical question about why would companies hire a Westerner I prefer to use this term for 4 times the salary of Asians According to a pure cost benefit point of view they would expect and should get a quadruple of productivity from the Westerner Question is do they companies or state for this matter get what they bargained for The answer is if indeed it is true that westerner are paid 4 times more a proposition that need to be investigated further a resounding YES as we can see more westerner is arriving and based on the cost benefit principle above companies feel that they still get ahead by hiring westerners Here we assume that no one companies or states is stupid enough to prefer losing instead of winning There s a catch though By productivity they may not only refer to tangible things such as amount of product you produce or sales achievement It may also include things such as prestige ie this real estate company is under British management or something as cynical as another poster put it fear or subconcious inferiority complex True or nor I don t know Myself If I think I am underpaid dont really care what my colleages get then I ll try to negotiate a better deal If I cannot get a better deal then I try to prove that I am underpaid by looking at a better job that give me more If I cannot find a better job then may be I m paid exactly what my market worth is might as well shut my mouth and enjoy NOte paid here mean the total compensation I get sallary job satisfaction quality of live traffic red tapes etc Enough bubling past my curfew Adios for tonight cheers SK

Q2189_C37	I have a basic question For I have a basic question For how many Indians middle east is first choice for work Usually those who work here are already rejected from US and european countries and 70 are rejected by their own country I don t know about other fields but the doctors working in middle east are substandard compared to their own counterparts in India and the european doctors are even more substandard to these already substandard doctors Now the conclusion is that quality control is a joke here Employing few europeans and one or two Americans makes things look good But they can t afford more than few and so they employ majority asians at cheapest rates to be cost effective And the end result is a substandard organisation which spends lots of money has poor performance and manipulated quality control usually through media Are you nuts no doubt I am crazy about you

Q2189_C39	a t sun26872 middle sun26872 middle east is first choice for MANY Indians so you re completely wrong about that one for a lot of Indians they don t mind coming to the mideast cos it s just a 3hr flight from home earnings are tax free there are a lot of people from their community town village they can t find that in the west it s too cold from them for half the year or more it s halfway around the world no way would they be able to afford that 16 hr flight ticket once a year like they do here they pay tax on their earnings put yourself in their shoes would the west still be your first choice i thought not You are right about the fact that most of the good Indian doctors India produces some of the best on the planet as i presume you know already choose to stay home or go west but it would be unfair to say that because of that ALL Indian doctors in the mideast are substandard or the European doctors here for that matter a lot of them move again for the tax free income to try a new place a new lifestyle a life partner who s based here there are so many things that factor into that descision Quality control as you rightly stated is in most cases a joke but again that doesn t apply across the board a well trained person wherever it is they are from is unlikely to compromise on standards

Q2189_C64	On a general level On a general level westerners seem to be able to DEMONSTRATE better levels of leadership and trouble shooting Just see how many countries are there in the west that are poor under developed developing compared to Asia Africa and its not that they have an advantage of natural resources or climate over others They can also sell themselves well They also tend to grasp the bigger picture well compared to the Asians who excel in specialising in a particular discipline of study But then this is only a generalisation This is not to say there arent any asians who cant do the same Whether you look at Mittal TATA SONY etc and what they have achieved in the west the Asians who work at high profile jobs in western countries or the IIM IIT graduates who are almost completely recruited by western companies there are enough proofs for Asian talent and capabilities But the issue is that due to the problems intrinsic to the demographics of Asian population there is quite a sizeable chunk of the population who have not been fortunate enough to get the same kind of education and exposure that their more fortunate counterparts could attain This particular section which is quite sizeable tips the balance when it comes to the general world view of the quality of asian workforce Also I am not quite sure how it works out in the west Do they pay less for asian employees like here in the middle east if not that is another pointer which could tell us that the workforce from Asia that ends up in gulf that includes yours truly is somehow the ones that couldnt make it in their own homes or in the west It could also mean the ME perception of Asians has a hand in this Before accusing anybody of RACISM in this matter what the Asians should think about is what exactly weighs in favor of the westerner and how to make the same factor work for them Its not skin its more than passport its the BRAND that has been created around it Like how sony made it in the west Morita knew how to combine creative cost effective engineering their core philosophy with product marketing and brand creation End of the day its about brand creation As much as I have seen brilliant managers from west I have also seen ones who have reached that position simply by virtue of their passport That is what you call brand value Not saying that there arent local Asian managers who have been lucky in a similiar way for them its other reasons Have we reached a place where we are ready to launch that brand that would do half the selling for us Till then Asians will have to put up with lesser pays Coz like everything one day this too shall pass

Q2581_C2	Hi Fado Given the situation Hi Fado Given the situation between a certain two countries I would not if I was you I have heard of people being asked to leave Qatar within 48 hours after asking for a transfer You should inquire with other people from your home country here and they can fill you in on it Its politics again 
Q2581_C3	Not possible You may have the NOC on hands from your current sponsor but the Immigration will not allows you to change your sponsor when you did not completed a 1 full year work visa with the same sponsor And working with another company not your sponsor is certainly illegal 
Q2581_C4	Apple If I m working for 6 months to may current sponsor and i will resign with NOC release paper from my sponsor As per advice to my next sponsor that i will exit to point of origin and they will just send the new visa plane ticket this is possible 
Q2581_C5	bingbong That is possible But your visa should be cancelled by your sponsor and you need NOC to return within the 2yrs banned period Note NOC to transfer sponsor is different from NOC to return w in 2yrs banned period 
Q2581_C6	Apple who will provide the NOC to return within the 2 yrs banned period is it the sponsor or immigration Tnx 
Q2581_C7	Definitely your current Definitely your current sponsor 
Q2581_C8	Apple Did you experience this situation coz I discuss the issue of some HR PRO the give me different answer the other one give me 95 assurance that I will not be banned but other PRO give 100 assurance that it will be ok to transfer to other sponsor with this two different assurance one thing the are in common that I will exit to my country of origin and back here in Doha for new visa 
Q2581_C9	You will be banned for 2yrs You will be banned for 2yrs once your RP is cancelled which is why you need to reassure that your current employer will grant you an NOC to return Please note that your RP must be cancelled prior to exit otherwise your new employer wont be able to apply a new visa for you Once you exit the State and with an NOC on hands things will be fine with you in God s will But changing sponsor within a year working of the same sponsor with a work visa permanent visa stamped on your passport and without EXIT will not be possible for you as per Immigration Rules You can double check with your company s PRO though 
Q2581_C10	fado Very Difficult Before or after a year its difficult to grant you one specially if your employer is Qatari Be careful please Salam 
Q2581_C11	I doubt if you will be able to change sponsorship within the first year That was the answer I was given when I tried in 2004 even though the company were prepared to give me an NOC and I had another job and sponsor lined up 
Q2581_C12	Apple Dweller Yes it is possible I have seen a guy who changed after 8 months of his joining In that case 1 THe first sponsor did give an NOC 2 The second sponsr was a strong reputed one In the abvoe criteria it can be possible 
Q2581_C13	guys no need to doubt it I guys no need to doubt it I HAVE CHANGED the sponsorship within 1 year I PERSONALLY As the matter of fact my RP was just 5 month old at that time Apple NOC is NOC It means the previous sponsor does not mind you to work for another company You can either transfer your sponsorship right away even within 1 year sometimes even without leaving qatar or you can leave Qatar to find another job and come back any time without waiting till 2 year ban is over All the guy needs is NOC letter And hey it s better not to belong to very few nationalities when as someone said he might be asked to leave qatar within 48 hours But this is a different story and has nothing to do with NOC or duration of work with the previous sponsor Some people try to just renew their RPs and asked to leave country So get a NOC and good luck with your new job i b You become responsible forever for what you have tamed Antoine de Saint Exupry b i img src http cdnll img1 imagechef com w 080610 anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef gif

Q2581_C15	Apple someone asked me Apple someone asked me once what are the immigration labour rules in Qatar My answer was simple Rule 1 and often the only 1 There are NO rules What is perfectly working for one irrespective of ones nationality gender age religion political preferences etc might not working for another irrespective of anothers nationality gender see above Moreover whatever worked for one person once might not work for the same person next time with the same name same passport number same nationality same gender see above So when the questing starts from IS IT POSSIBLE the answer is EVERYTHING is possible And that was my point dear how are you anyway Long time i b You become responsible forever for what you have tamed Antoine de Saint Exupry b i img src http cdnll img1 imagechef com w 080610 anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef gif
