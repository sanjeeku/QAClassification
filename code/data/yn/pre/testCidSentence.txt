Q2922_C11	rezyz do you mean locals rezyz do you mean locals should give privet classes for people who needs there are noooooooo qatari gives classes and this will not happen this job is for people from north africa not for us 
Q2922_C12	Don t be a snob qatari citizen Do you think you are superior to North Africans As I said there are local women who teach Arabic And there are alternatives to people from the magreb teaching Arabic Look at all the people here from Palestine Iraq Syria Lebanon Jordan and Egypt although I wouldn t study Egyptian Arabic because every other Arab laughs at you 
Q2922_C13	for qatari citizen for ur information north africans are tunisian and moroccan and if u claim that it is up to them ti teach arabic then u assert that they are arabs or how could they teach a language they do not speak allow me to say that u r speaking out of ignorance it is true we are not 100 pure arabs but the islamic openenigs were centuries ago we speak better arabic than u and better french than u and better english than u despite the fact that we dont use it on a daily basics as for me i have a BA in english literature and teaching i have a good accent as well as we have special courses for pronunciation and speaking as for my writings i do teach better than i write it is internet im not going 2b so formal p 
Q2922_C14	it is bcz of arabs like u it is bcz of arabs like u that we are excluding ourselves but beware that there is no difference between arabs nor maghrebins nor any other ethnicity bcz Allah look into our hearts and how pious we r 
Q2922_C15	Baya you don t use English on a daily basics I rest my case This is not a case of text speak it is a case of fluency and your post doesn t reflect solid knowledge of English grammar and vocabulary Also I have heard Moroccans Algerians and Tunisians speak English even ones that earned a university degree in English and their pronunciation is never that of a native speaker A good friend of mine has a Moroccan wife who has a PhD in English from one of their major universities and although her grammar and vocabulary was great she couldn t really tutor because students wanted someone who had a native accent and 99 times out of a hundred that will not be someone who studied English in a foreign university Sorry but my wife was an English teacher for many years and still tutors and I am still surprised at what passes for teaching in many cases
