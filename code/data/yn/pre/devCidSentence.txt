Q2717_C1	Don t get me wrong doody I Don t get me wrong doody I myself have honey cheerios at home which I on occasion eat cause they re quite tasty What I meant to say though it didn t come across properly was that the advertising campaign that Nestle cheerios has is over exaggerated Companies like nestle tend to amplify what little nutritional value their products have to convince consumers to buy them Like expat sueno says they are a bit healthier than the other stuff out there but at the same time they re still not that healthy Anyway I don t mean to be a diet Nazi you should eat what you wish Oh and I have to agree with Doratheexplorer I m not sure about giving cheerios to a baby you d have to check up on that

Q2717_C8	Oh and don t buy into that Oh and don t buy into that wholegrain healthy crap that all these cereals advertised They re all still pretty heavily processed Best healthiest thing to do for breakfast is eat as much protein as you can hence eggs are highly recommended 
Q2717_C9	you re right to an extent villagejoker Cheerios are processed absolutely However on an overall basis they re much healthier than most of the other garbage out there that is marketed to mums for their babies toddlers The sugar content of plain ol Cheerios is also far lower than that of sugared cereals and other snacks which are generally even more processed than Cheerios Some of the sugared cereals are up to 50 sugar by weight and more than that as a of calories Even some of the yogurts have more grams of sugar per serving than a full sized can of Coke thanks to all the added sugar and high fructose corn syrup Plain unsweetened unflavored yogurt does contain natural sugar as does fruit but nowhere near the sugar levels of the typical fruit yogurt here in Qatar Nothing is ever truly perfect in the snack food world but we can strive for the best we can find I just try to read the labels and use common sense o
